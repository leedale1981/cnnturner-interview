# Interview challenge.

I have created two seperate projects here.

The first one is an API which makes calls to the twitter API.

The second is the client which makes calls to the API to get tweets.

The API service will need to be running at http://localhost:31000 and the client project will run at http://localhost:30000.

You can start both services with ```NPM run start``` from their respective folders.
